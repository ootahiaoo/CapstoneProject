## Optional future tasks:

- Merge similar code logics
- Create the Settings options "Share" (to share the currently viewed repository or events) and
"Refresh" (to refresh the result)
- Add Connpass option, change the home UI to use Paging (to display the results from GitHub, Meetup
and Connpass APIs in different tabs)
- Implement NavigationUI for Drawer?
- Change Retrofit response handling for MeetupEvent to use less POJO
